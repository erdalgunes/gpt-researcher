# ENH-002: Comprehensive Testing Framework

## Implementation Summary

✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive testing framework setup:

### Test Structure
- `tests/unit/agents/` - Unit tests for individual agents
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests for multi-agent workflows  
- `tests/mocks/` - Mock implementations for external dependencies

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Pytest with async support configured
- ✅ Unit tests for ReviewerAgent (7 test cases)
- ✅ Integration tests for multi-agent workflow
- ✅ Mock LLM provider for consistent testing
- ✅ Proper test isolation and setup
- ✅ Coverage for critical agent functionality

### Test Coverage Areas
- Agent method existence and callability
- Guidelines compliance logic
- Draft acceptance/revision decisions  
- Mock external dependencies (LLMs, web)
- Agent communication and data flow
- Workflow integration testing

### Usage
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test suite
python -m pytest tests/unit/agents/
python -m pytest tests/integration/

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest -v
```

### Next Steps for Full Coverage
- Add tests for remaining agents (ResearchAgent, WriterAgent, etc.)
- Add end-to-end workflow tests
- Add performance/load testing
- Add CI/CD integration with coverage reporting
