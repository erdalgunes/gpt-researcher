# BUG-002: ReviewerAgent Missing run() Method

## Investigation Results

✅ **RESOLVED** - ReviewerAgent.run() method is properly implemented:

- Method exists and is callable
- Proper async implementation  
- Correct signature: `run(draft_state: dict)`
- Returns expected schema: `{"review": review_result}`
- Successfully integrated in workflow (editor.py line 132)

## Implementation Details

The `run()` method:
1. Checks if guidelines should be followed
2. Calls `review_draft()` if guidelines are enabled
3. Returns standardized response format
4. Handles both acceptance (None) and revision feedback

## Testing

Method properly handles:
- Draft acceptance (returns {"review": None})
- Draft revision (returns {"review": feedback_string})
- Guidelines compliance checking
- Verbose logging integration

## Status
✅ WORKING AS INTENDED - Issue may have been resolved in previous commits
