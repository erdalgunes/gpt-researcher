# BUG-001: Fix Syntax Errors in Agent Modules

## Investigation Results

Checked all Python files in multi_agents/agents/ for syntax errors:
- No critical syntax errors found (E9, F63, F7, F82)
- No concatenated import/return patterns found
- All files compile successfully

## Status
âœ… RESOLVED - No syntax errors detected in current codebase

The issue may have been already resolved in previous commits.
All agent modules pass Python compilation and flake8 critical checks.
